Hat-Box is a simple template for cutting out your own Hat sized protective box for your Hat add-on boards for the Raspberry Pi. 

## What are Hats?

'HATs' (Hardware Attached on Top). Is a specification for add-on boards for the Raspberry Pi. This allows hardware makers the opportunity to have conform to a standard compatible with the 40pin configuration for the Raspberry Pi (from model B+).

Basically it means a lot of your add-on boards that are called Hats will be the same size.

## Why do we need a box

I own a hat with a lcd on top. With all the movement in my toolbox the screen got damaged. That sucked so I wanted to find something to protect my boards. I looked at Tool boxes, craft boxes, bags and pouches. Nothing seemed to fit the size of the Hats and actually keep them separate. 

Anoying!

So I made my own out of card!
